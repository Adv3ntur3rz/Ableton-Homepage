# Ableton Homepage
 An interactive homepage concept for Ableton written in p5.js

 Try it out [here](https:/randiel.zoquier.com/web-projects/ableton-sketch/)!

## What does it do?
 When the user clicks on one of the animated slices on the page it plays a slice of an audio sample, reflecting the way that users of the Ableton software might slice audio to create music.
